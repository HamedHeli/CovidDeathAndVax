# SQL Projects
Here, I am describing some of the SQL projects that I have done. The projects have been performed inspired by the courses that I took or my personal intersts. 
Two projects are included:
  * :mask: [Covi-19 Data Exploration](https://github.com/HamedHeli/PythonProjects/blob/016d47925324a5e1714614c3592f54bab88cb5ab/Bank%20Stock%20Market/Bank%20Stock%20After%20Covid%20.ipynb) (completed): 
      
      In this project, I got Covid death and vaccination data from [ourworldindata website](https://ourworldindata.org/), cleaned data, and derived initial insights. The following transactions are done on the data:
      
      * Joining Data to Collect Information in the Same Table 
      * Data Cleaning and Creating Pivot Table 
      * Data Manipulating and Defining New Metrics for Initial Data Insights



  * :house: [Nashville Housing Data Cleaning](https://github.com/HamedHeli/SQLProjects/blob/a4c737d50168d407b9ff939d185ae92fb1c8cf1d/Data-Cleaning/DataCleaning.sql) (completed): 
      
      In this project, I cleaned housing market data. The data cleaning procedure includes the following transactions:
      
      * Detecting Null values and filling them by using the data from other rows  
      * Breaking the address into stress, city, and states 
      * Discovering incosistency in data and modify the information so each column has consistent data
